# nhn-underline-plugin
The [TUI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) is a text editor that supports Markdown. Markdown does not support underlining, so the TUI Editor does not support underlining as well. But underlining is a common feature of normal text editors, so it should be supported in the TUI Editor.

Simply include this plugin to the TUI Editor to add an underline button!
